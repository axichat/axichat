Axichat is a free and open-source XMPP (Jabber) chat client built with Flutter. Privacy and
end-to-end encryption are first-class features, backed by OMEMO2 and SQLCipher storage.

TODO:
- Describe the flagship features (multi-account roster, OMEMO setup, calendar/tasks, etc.).
- Explain how message storage works locally and how users can export/import history.
- Link to the privacy policy and document what data (if any) leaves the device.
- Add localized support information if you publish in additional languages.
