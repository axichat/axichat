Summary: Free XMPP and email messenger with an integrated calendar.

Description: |
  Axichat is a free, open-source XMPP messenger that also speaks email and ships
  a powerful calendar and task system. It stores credentials securely with
  SQLCipher and never depends on Firebase or proprietary services. Features
  include drag-and-drop scheduling, DeltaChat-compatible email transport, and
  offline-friendly messaging with end-to-end encryption on your device.
