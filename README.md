## Why?

- **Tools matter** - Would you rather write a letter while standing up outside or sitting at your
  desk? Using the right software makes the same difference. Axichat is a digital desk for your
  online communication.
- **Time matters** - You can always make more money, but not more time. Axichat's calendar is
  designed to help you seize the day, and our chat-like email formatting helps you avoid spending it
  reading what you don't want to, retyping information, opening the wrong emails, and spamming
  alt+tab.
- **Privacy matters** - “Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have
  nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have
  nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden

## What?

### Best chat interface:

- Get Axichat's cutting-edge UI, even if your recipients are not on Axichat yet.
- Read and send emails+attachments using our stunning chat interface no matter where your recipients
  are: Gmail, Outlook, Tuta, etc.
- When talking to someone also on Axichat, get extra features: Groupchats, Reactions, Delivery
  Receipts, and more.

### Best calendar in the world:

- Natural language parsing (without any AI) so you can just type in what, when, how long, how often,
  due by, and more in any way you want and the calendar will automatically schedule it into the grid
  for you. Don't worry about tweaking 30 different inputs to plan a basic task.
- If you don't know when it needs to get done, that's fine; we just put it in the unscheduled list
  so you can quickly and easily dump your stream-of-consciousness.
- If it has a deadline then we will notify you when it is getting close.
- Excellent for planning your entire personal routine, featuring a built-in Eisenhower Matrix so you
  can put first things first.
- Intuitive UI/UX that works seamlessly on every screen with drag+drop to reschedule, drag to
  resize, copy+paste, batch edit, and much more.
- Available in Guest Mode so you don't even need an account or internet to use it.
- Scheduling, task management, and reminders all in one place with natural language processing (no
  AI) for frictionless use.
