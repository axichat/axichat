- important+urgent = red, important = green, urgent = yellow, neither = grey. these colors should be
  reflected in all accents and ui. right now the accents for grey are white instead
- tasks should be intuitively resizable, like dragging the edges of a box to make it larger and
  smaller over an area, but the area is atomic, made up of cells instead of continuous.
- tasks should be draggable to the schedule and back off the schedule.
- there should be 3 kinds of tasks: unscheduled, scheduled, and reminders which are deadline based
- the side bar should have two stacked vertically expanding lists, like an accordion. tapping the
  reminder tab opens reminders and shrinks the unscheduled list back down, and vice versa.
- day zoom view should display 15 minute increments (:15, :30, :45) in the time column
- scheduled tasks should have repeat inputs in their edit dropdown, and all the fields in the edit
  dropdown should be initially available as a dropdown in the sidebar under an advanced options
  button.
- edit dropdowns should also have a deadline field
- the edit dropdown the completed toggle should look different to important/urgent toggles as it
  is a different concept
- the edit dropdown should be closely attached to its task and stay anchored to its task when
  scrolling
- the date text in the top right is too big and the icon is ugly

Stage 2

- advanced options animated in from the side, which doesnt make sense. they should fade in or
  animate from the top.
- clicking on unscheduled/reminder tab should close them if they are open in addition to opening
  them if they are closed
- the does not repeat option looks outdated and is too simple, it should have frequency and
  repeating on specific days
- the default width of the sidebar should be 1/3 of screen, max should be 1/2 and min should be 1/4
- important and urgent should always be checkboxes instead of switched, and the schedule on calendar
  option should just be a button that opens and closes the dropdown, not a switch button
- dragging horizontally to resize does not work at all. a task should be smooth across multiple
  days, not broken up, and dragging the right side does nothing while dragging the left is inverted.
  horizontal dragging needs a complete rework. get rid of dayspan it is a silly concept
- ui elements are not consistent. all text inputs should be the same as the one currently in the add
  task side bar.
- the horizontal borders between cells should extends through the left time column. the right
  vertical border of the time column should extend up through the top row date headers
- there is no edit dropdown for scheduled tasks either
- the schedule cells should be more vertically compact
